# arduino-halloween-torches
IR controlled LED torches powered by an Arduino Gemma. This project is the visual aspect of a 2 part setup. The 2nd part is the control box that sends IR commands to the torches. Torches will sit in a 'smoldering' state with lower leds set to red. Motion triggers the torches to a low gutter style animation. Close proximty (using an ultra sonic range finder) will trigger the torches in a high burn state. The effect is the torches light and burn high when approaching the control box.

I re-programmed then below project.
